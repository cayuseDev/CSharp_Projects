# CSharp_Projects

In this folder are the projects, I have completed.

The projects are reproductions (with client details removed) of applications I have coded as a developer on the Competitive Intelligence Team.  

The ‘contracts’ folder has the projects done on the side of my primary employment.

The applications are downloadable and function fully.  I have included screenshots for those that might violate download policy.
